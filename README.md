<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is first assignment of Computational Creativity.
Create Yoga Routine using Makrov Chain.

Yoga is a habit of mine. When you do yoga everyday, you soon run out of routines. It's easy to stuck in a specific routine that can lose its alpha. Inspired by the ideas of Makrov chain, I made a program that creates a sequence of yoga poses to create a routine. Each pose is a state of Makrov chain. Probabilities of the transitions between yoga poses are created and stored in the transition matrix.

This project is meaningful to me because this is a program that I would use. I want creative routines to stimulate me and move me to next level.

This project really challenged me both in both programming aspect and creative aspect. Working with the concept of creativity in computer science was novel to my computer science experience. To get results that I would not expect was something that I had to get used to. Working with images and creating UI using tkinter was a challenge for me as well.

My system is creative because this system breaks the norms or routines of ordinary yoga experience.
